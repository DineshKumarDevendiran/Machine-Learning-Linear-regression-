# Simple Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook presenting a simple linear regression analysis performed by the analytics team. The primary focus is to understand the impact of radio promotions on sales within our company. The dataset used in this analysis includes information about TV, radio, and social media campaigns, along with the corresponding revenue generated.

The goal of the analysis is to explore the relationship between the budget allocated to radio promotions and the resulting revenue. The insights derived from this analysis will help inform future marketing decisions and resource allocation.

## Content

- `Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the detailed analysis.
- `marketing_sales_data.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.

## Steps

1. **Import necessary packages and load the dataset**: The notebook starts by importing the required libraries and loading the dataset (`marketing_sales_data.csv`).

2. **Data exploration**: This section explores the dataset, checking for missing values, understanding data types, and performing descriptive statistics. It also includes visualization using pair plots to understand relationships between variables.

3. **Model Building**: The notebook then proceeds to build a simple linear regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach. The focus is on the relationship between radio promotions and sales.

4. **Results and Evaluation**: This section provides a summary of the regression results, including statistical interpretation. Assumptions of the model, such as linearity and normality, are also checked.

5. **Conclusion**: The notebook concludes with an interpretation of the simple linear regression model and statistical results. The README file serves as a guide to understand the contents and purpose of the notebook.
